A PHP CMS based on Edwin Diaz's tutorial on Udemy.  It's under construction now, so if you load this up you'll be able to inject SQL into it and other things that are total garbage.  I'll update this when there's a beta ready to roll.  The plan is to finish v1.0 of functionality, deploy it, and then style it to make it look like the terminal.
